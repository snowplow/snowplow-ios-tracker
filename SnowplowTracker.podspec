    Snowplow is a mobile and event analytics platform with a difference: rather than tell our users how they should analyze their data, we deliver their event-level data in their own data warehouse, on their own Amazon Redshift or Postgres database, so they can analyze it any way they choose. Snowplow mobile is used by data-savvy games companies and app developers to better understand their users and how they engage with their games and applications. Snowplow is open source using the business-friendly Apache License, Version 2.0 and scales horizontally to many billions of events.
