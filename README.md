## Overview

Add analytics to your iOS, OSX and tvOS apps and games with the **[Snowplow][2]** event tracker for **[iOS 8.0+][3]**, **[OSX 10.9+][4]** and **[tvOS 9.0+][5]**.

With this tracker you can collect event data from your applications, games or frameworks.

### Building the Static Framework (iOS only)

* Open `Snowplow.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
* Select the `SnowplowTracker-iOS-Static` scheme and set device to `iOS Device`.
* Run `Archive` from the Product menu.
* Finder should open and show you where `SnowplowTracker.framework` is stored.

### Running the Demo Application (iOS only)

* Open `SnowplowDemo.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
* Select the `SnowplowDemo` scheme and set device to any emulator.
* Hit run and the demo will be installed and launched in the emulator window.
* Simply enter a valid endpoint to send events to!

### Setting up a local testing endpoint

Assuming git, **[Vagrant][vagrant-install]** and **[VirtualBox][virtualbox-install]** installed:

```bash
 host$ git clone https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-objc-tracker.git
 host$ cd snowplow-objc-tracker
 host$ vagrant up && vagrant ssh
guest$ cd /vagrant
guest$ mb &
guest$ curl -X POST -d @/vagrant/integration-tests/imposter.json http://localhost:2525/imposters
```

Your local endpoint will be `http://localhost:4545` which can be used in the demonstration application.

To view sent events in your browser please navigate to `http://localhost:2525`.
